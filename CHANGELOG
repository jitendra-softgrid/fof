FOF 4.0.0.a1
================================================================================

Backwards compatibility notes
----------------------------------------
* Large part of FOF have been rewritten in version 4 and breaks b/c. Good news: you can have FOF 3 and FOF 4 run side by
  side thanks to the new version using namespaces. Please consult the documentation wiki in the GitHub repository for
  information on how FOF 4 works.

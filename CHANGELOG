FOF 4.0.0.a1
================================================================================

Backwards compatibility notes
----------------------------------------
* Large part of FOF have been rewritten in version 4 and breaks b/c. Good news: you can have FOF 3 and FOF 4 run side by
  side thanks to the new use of namespaces.
* FOF 4 is licensed under GPL v3 or later. FOF 3 was licensed under GPL v2 or later. Your extensions need to use the new
  license version.
* FOF 4's forms are written against the markup provided by FEF. If you want to use XML forms you will need to provide
  your own layout overrides. Kindly note that FEF is NOT GPL and you can NOT distribute it with your extensions.
  Alternatively, do not use XML forms (recommended).
* Minimum requirements changed to PHP 5.6, Joomla! 3.7.
* The deprecated features have been removed
    * FOF40\Encrypt\AesAdapter\AdapterInterface::setEncryptionMode() no longer has the second parameter (strength).
    * Passing null to FOF40\Model\DataModel::blacklistFilters instead of using getBlacklistFilters
    * FOF40\Utils\StringHelper::toSlug()
    * FOF40\Utils\StringHelper::toASCII()
    * FOF40\View\View::loadHelper()
    * Support for legacy tokens (passed _token=SESSION_OR_FORM_TOKEN instead of SESSION_OR_FORM_TOKEN=1)
    * Numeric field (now it's called Number for PHP 7 compatibility).
* The AkeebaStrapper renderer has been removed. Use the Joomla3 renderer instead
* Removed LESS support

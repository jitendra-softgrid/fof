After merging FOF and Joomla field classes
    - Copy over the layouts from core Joomla into FOF and update the respective field classes
    - Change the HTML markup of all fields to use FEF
    - Note down which fields go through JHtml, track down their layouts and clone them too
    - Either convince JHtml to use a different layout file or, if not possible, fork the JHtml class
    - Convert the JHtml-specific layout fiels to FEF

Convert the header elements as well

FormField's getLayoutPaths should return by default a list defined in fof.xml (defined relative to the site's root, I need to make it absolute)
The default value, if nothing else is specified, would be the layout folder inside the component itself.
Maybe we can refactor FormField to
    a. get a common prefix from the Renderer
    b. get a layout path from the Renderer

NO DO NOT DO THAT: "Create FormHeader to replace HeaderInterface"
    Header elements are FormFields which implement a different interface.
    The common code should go into a trait instead.
